# 1985-checkmate


This is a Work-In-Progress-But-Now-Cancelled game of chess made with Pixi.js.
At the moment there is no turn system, no castling, no promoting, etc.. It has the basic moves for each piece, checks for checkmate and shows the possible moves for a selected piece.

[Demo here](https://mricarte-i.github.io/1985-checkmate/)


Really, the most interesting part for me was getting the sprites for the pieces and the tiles from the spritesheets.
